  <p>As I'm writing posts in this blog I have some ideas
for improving the workflow. For one, I am currently unable
to quickly link to other posts within the blog. This should be
easy to resolve. In my private notes I use vim-zettel, which allows
me to use a shortcut to search through other notes in my directory and
link to them.</p>
<p>Another feature that would be very useful is to be able to search for web links
right from the editor. For example if I am referencing an episode of the
Huberman Lab podcast, it would be extremely nice to have a shortcut like for
the local notes, which pulls data from a search engine. If I could get that
experience to be similar to using fzf inside the editor, this would be super
exciting.</p>
