These walks should happen at least twice a week.</p>

<p><strong>Analyzing wanderings</strong></p>
<p>Wanderings tended to occur when I came across people. The wanderings also seemed to cluster
toward the end of a ten minute sprint.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for improvement</strong></p>
<p>Once I had started visualizing the chapters of the book and placing them along
the route of my walk (method of loci) focusing became a lot easier. Having the
visual places to go to and jump between provided a focal point which it was
easy to come back to.</p>
<p>This leads to one concrete improvement: Before starting, outline a path through the material
which can be followed during the walk.</p>
<p>What also seemed to help was tying the visualizations to the location. One
strategy I used was to spread the images out over the entire available space of
a location. The feeling of being able to walk &quot;inside&quot; the visualization was
helpful and it also provided a better connection to the location.</p>
<p>Another strategy I found was to flip from the horizontal perspective into
vertical birds eye perspective. This enables one to see all the locations like
in a map and makes it easier to jump between places.</p>
