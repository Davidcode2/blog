  Hammering out the initial version of a post is fun and easy. Editing is hard. 
  I want to learn how to arrive at a focused and structured piece. The approach 
  I'll try is to hammer out a post, reflect on it by chunking paragraphs and repeating 
  until arriving at a satisfactory result. 
</div>
    </div>
<p>As I write posts on this blog, I'm slowly familiarizing myself with the
challenges of writing. I'm quite happy about having learned a while ago, i
think in some YouTube video, that one can just hammer out the words that come
to mind without stopping. This is an incredibly fun kind of writing.</p>
<p>I can imagine it being very difficult when perfection is the objective. Sitting
there in front of an empty editor buffer seems stressful.</p>
<p>Recently I got some confirmation for this strategy of simply hammering out the
thoughts at speed by Richard E. Nisbett, in his book
<a href="../mindware_nisbett">&quot;Book: Mindware by Richard Nisbett&quot;</a>. He quotes someone saying
that for any work to start happening on writing one must have something written
down, even if it is the most ridiculous rough draft. The subconscious needs to
get primed or triggered to be able to tackle the task of forming a coherent
structure out of the disconnected thoughts that initially flow to the page.</p>
<p>Up to this point I've been only hammering out stuff. So everything that can be
read here until mid 2025 is something of a direct readout of my brain. Now for
high quality and persuasive writing I'm sure we can agree that something more
needs to happen.</p>
<h2>Refactoring Posts</h2>
<p>Today I tried to move on to this second step of refining the jumble that comes
out in the initial hammering phase. It was quite hard. I think I spent like a
good half hour on a tiny paragraph in the <a href="../250417-1718-trying_to_synthesize_learnings_on_life_design">Trying to synthesize learnings on life design</a> post.
And the result wasn't even any good. So I'll have quite a bit of learning and practicing
to do on this. Let's think about what this second step of refinement entails. For that
it might be useful to zoom out a bit and look at the writing process as a whole.</p>
<h2>Writing as an aid to thinking</h2>
<p>Why do I write in the first place? To get a better understanding of things I
learn, be able to make connections between different topics and ideas, and to
arrive at new insights that help me better understand the world. It's also
about improving my memory. Not by providing a written record (although that's
useful too) but by consciously processing the stuff that's floating around in
my head. Clive Thompson also talks about how writing can help organize ones
thinking. More on this book here:
<a href="../smarter_than_you_think">&quot;Book: Smarter Than You Think&quot;</a>.
Another aspect is that writing like this is just a lot of fun.</p>
<h2>Objectives of writing</h2>
<p>So that's my motivation as a hobby blogger. What might a person who would
eventually like to make money by writing or someone like a software engineer
who relies on good writing skills on the job need to get from his writing
practice? A coherent structure would be nice to have. Also persuasiveness, to
get the reader to buy into the ideas I might want to advocate.</p>
<h2>Critical thinking through writing</h2>
<p>What I think I need as a next step is to improve on the practice to make my
arguments clearer to myself, and to question assumptions to get closer to a
truth. I think Charlie Munger is attributed as saying something like &quot;I don't
allow myself an opinion on something unless I've thought all the thoughts that
can be thought against it.&quot; I'm very sure what he said is different but the
idea was something like that. I'll have to look it up in Shane Parrish's book
where I think I stumbled across that one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice how I am now linking to other posts in this blog? That's because now I've set up a separate
vimwiki for my blog. See this post for the process <a href="../improving_blogging">Improve blogging</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Benefit of my writing so far</h2>
<p>I guess that thus far my writing has been useful in somewhat organizing my
learnings better and to improve my recollection by performing active recall on
the books I've read and ideas I collected elsewhere. And it has been fun.</p>
<h2>Lack of formal knowledge about writing</h2>
<p>While writing this I notice that I haven't got a large store of knowledge about
writing. I might not have read anything specifically focused on writing. That's
a gap I'll have to close. To start with, I'll get me a nice overview from
GenAI.</p>
<h2>Chunking</h2>
<p>Now let's get to the challenge I had while editing the brain dump in an earlier
post. First of all I had to recollect what my purpose was in that specific
piece. I had to know the context in which that paragraph stood and how it
related to the rest of the post. I think a good way to go about this would be
to get a high level mental representation of the post by creating clear
separations and chunking parts. These chunks can then be labeled with headings
to make it easier for the mind to get a handle on the post. In this step it
might already become obvious that some parts are duplicated or would fit in at
another place in the post.</p>
<h2>Separating conceptualization from committing changes</h2>
<p>Here we might already be able to move around chunks. But this would be a
destructive action since it might break dependencies to other parts that we're
previously below the moved part and now no longer make sense. So I'd like to
separate the conceptualization step from the action step where I actually make
changes. I like how there's a connection coming up to programming.</p>
<p>There seems to be some value here: The writing itself is what went incredibly
quickly when creating the first draft but slowly when editing. So I'd like
to move the actual writing to the end of the editing process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We now have a two step process
of hammering and editing. Thinking about it like this makes it seem that we
we get only one pass at hammering. Editing is brownfield work. We'll see if
we can get us a process that allows us to go back and forth between the two
steps.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Process of chunking</h2>
<p>Let's break down the edit step: First I'll look at the purpose of the post.
I'll get an overview of what's written and break it down into sensible chunks.
This happens by inserting line breaks. Then I'll look into the resulting
chunks in more detail and find appropriate headings. By this point I will
already have decent mental map of the post.</p>
<h2>Diverging and contracting</h2>
<p>Perhaps a mode of diverging and contracting like in the double diamonds method
from design thinking can come in handy here. After contracting in the chunking
and labeling step, I could diverge and check for any missing ideas or thoughts
that would fit in with the post.</p>
<h2>Finding the unity of a post</h2>
<p>Maybe the other way around is better, to contract at this stage and find the
true purpose of the post and close in on the main idea that needs to be
transported. To lend a term from Mortimer J. Adler's Book, &quot;How to read a book&quot;,
I could try to find the &quot;unity&quot; of the post. The unity is a description of a
book only a few sentences long.</p>
<p>I'm trying to get to the point where I can start writing again after the
conceptualization phase but am struggling to find a segue there. The place I
want to be after the conceptualization phase is to be as close as possible to
be able to hammer again. But this time with better structure and stronger
arguments.</p>
<h2>Iterations of hammering and conceptualization</h2>
<p>Maybe an iterative approach could work, where I repeat hammering and
conceptualization phases until the result is a strong written piece.
That would entail a lot of hammering. My first thought was that this sucks and is
a lot of work but I'm now kind of excited. This is a grand example of
a drill as specified in Ultralearning by Scott H. Young (See <a href="../ultralearning">&quot;Book: Ultralearning&quot;</a>).
So maybe that's the way to go.</p>
<p>To fantasize a little, wouldn't it be nice that at some point after extensive
practice I would have the conceptualization phase so ingrained that it would
happen subconsciously at the time of the first hammering? So I would end up
with a polished post after half an hour of hammering out and enjoying myself.</p>
