  <h2>Exercise plan for greatness</h2>
<p>After reading the book &quot;Peak - secrets from the new science of expertise&quot; by
Anders Erricson I want to create a plan for improving in a structured manner.</p>
<h3>Retain focus for one hour</h3>
<p>In order to improve ones learning and execution capabilities, one needs to
possess the ability to retain focus for extended periods of time.
Let's break down what is needed to achieve this goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to follow a train of thought for a specified time</li>
<li>The ability to quickly bring the mind back to the train of thought when it wanders</li>
<li>Reducing the number of times the mind wanders within a specified time frame</li>
</ul>
<p>These three sub goals should allow us to progress toward the larger goal.
Each of these goals can be practiced deliberately.</p>
<p>Upon researching exercises for improving focus I got
the following from Gemini. The one minute focus exercise. It sounds interesting
and I should see whether it works relatively quickly.</p>
<p>It goes like this: Set timer. Focus one the breath for one minute.
Estimate how many times the mind wanders. If one minute is too long do it
shorter, if too little do it longer. If the mind wanders during the specified
time, reduce in 15 second increments. If it does not, increase in 30 second
increments. Note down why the mind wandered and track progress.</p>
<p>Next to focus, one also needs the juice up the working memory to be able
to retain the stuff of an hour long mental journey.</p>
<p>One strategy to overcome this could be visualization.
It could be used to sketch out the train of thought. This will make
it easier to jump between different points and make connections.</p>
<h3>Type 140 words / minute with accuracy &gt; 95 %</h3>
<p>Type 140 words per minute on my laptop keyboard with an accuracy of &gt; 95 %
by July.
To achieve this goal I will have to reduce the number of mistakes I make by practicing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>correct typing form with each finger responsible for the correct letters on the keyboard.</li>
<li>reading speed / thinking speed - I need to be able to provide the inputs for my typing<br>
fast enough either by coming up with thought of my own or by reading text which I can type up.
For the sake of practice I will go with provided text as there are tools available for just that.</li>
<li>correct pacing. I need to learn to correctly pace my typing to avoid making mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Retain and navigate learnings from books</h3>
<p>Gain a fast and deep understanding of books that I read. I want to build the
ability to quickly build mental representations which will be easy to retain.
The mental representations should enable me to go back to material that I have
read and connect different Ideas. Goal number one will support this goal as
following a train of thought will enable me to build a detailed mental
representation in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Design practice: Read books in timed increments. I will set a timer for 10
minutes and read during that time. After that, I take a moment to build a
mental representation of what I have learned. I will then note down a quick
summary. Use method of loci to place insights.</p>
<p>To overcome the issue of running out of places: Reuse places with different
themes.</p>
<h3>Draw architecture diagrams with PlantUML</h3>
<p>Build architecture models with plantUML quickly.
Break down the goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be able to use plantUML and quickly choose between different view models.</li>
<li>Be able to hold a mental representation of the architecture in my head and
focus on the parts that are relevant for the model.</li>
<li>Be able to move between different levels of abstraction
<ul>
<li>Have a good mental representation of the architecture</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Make it specific and measurable: Be able to draw a model of a previously
unknown architecture with plantUML in half an hour after first seeing the
software. The size of the software does not matter. The model will differ in
the level of abstraction depending on the complexity of the architecture.</p>
<p>How to train: draw architecture models of software systems that I know.
How to get feedback: Ask colleagues who know the software about feedback</p>
<p>This goals also works toward the more general ability to quickly build good
mental representations.</p>
