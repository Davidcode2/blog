## Schemas

Everything’s is an inference. We do not have access to our thought processes.
When people tell us about why they behave a certain way or why they hold some
opinion we tend to believe them. The truth is that they probably make all that
up on the fly. It is certainly true for myself. When I come up with some
thought I don’t have a clear thread that leads me to where that came from.
Rather it is all made up as I go. Makes me wonder how much we really work like
an LLM.

We make our judgments about the world based on stereotypes and schemas we
learned at some point. These stereotypes color our perception.

  good or bad, but thinking makes it so.<br>

## Framing 

Through framing we can reach pretty much any outcome we like. Even obviously
contradicting ones like the following: a monk asks the friar whether it is Ok
to smoke while he prays. The friar is outraged. Obviously not. God demands our
full attention. The other monk asks the friar whether he may pray while he
smokes. Sure thing.

Imagine working yourself up a tricky mountain path. Somewhere up above a stone 
breaks loose and hurls past you.
Now maybe you get some strong feelings toward the other hikers going along with you.
You'll feel like the near death experience brings you closer. What's actually happening
is that you attribute the racing heart to your fellow travelers rather than to the 
loose stone.

When we attribute our feelings to another person or event when they really come
from other circumstances, psychologists speak of the Fundamental Attribution
Error (FAE). We make this mistake all the time. When I meet someone on a sunny
day I might forever store them as a warm person whereas when I meet them on a
cloudy day they might seem glum to me. If someone hands me a warm cup of coffee
I might perceive them as approachable. I’ll have no clue that my perception is
influenced by this complete triviality. 

What can we learn from that? We might not take ourselves and our opinions too
seriously. When we say something today that is completely contradictory to what
we said two years ago we might not be too harsh on the person who points out
the fact. We might just take it as a fact of life.

## The unconscious

The unconscious is a powerful processing tool for tackling hard problems
involving lots of variables and hunches we might not be able to clearly
articulate. The workings of the unconscious are inaccessible to us. But we can
benefit from the work when the subliminal crosses the threshold into the
conscious mind. One way to make use of the unconscious is to write down a
problem we face in the evening and see the next morning if there’s something
the brain came up with while we slept.

## Decisions

### Cost benefit analysis

Economics discusses the choices we make in everyday life. Cost benefit analysis
allows us to make better decisions. It consists of the following steps:

1. list possible actions
2. list affected parties
3. list costs and benefits for each action
4. Find a measurement value (like money)
5. Predict the outcome of each cost and benefit over the relevant time period
6. Weight these outcome predictions by their probability
7. Discount the outcome predictions by their proximity in time (owning a house
   today gives you more value than in owning it in 20 years). What you’ll get
   is the net present value.
8. Do sensitivity analysis (adjust based on possible mistakes in costs and
   benefits or estimating probabilities

### Tragedy of the commons

When we consider the earths health (like the atmosphere or ozone layer) I might
get a benefit of +1 when I take a flight. If you take a flight you will also
get a benefit of +1. But we will both only have a cost of 1/eight billion. The
problem is that we don’t see as individuals when the costs outweigh the
benefits because we’ll only ever see the +1 benefit for ourselves and neglect
the minuscule cost for everyone. Since nobody sees that, we’re screwed at some
point. Another analogy is that of the herders who shepherd their sheep
on a common pasture. Everyone gets a benefit of +1 when they add one sheep of
their own and a minimal cost due to the amount of grass available to the sheep
declining. At some point over grazing occurs and everyone loses everything.

### Sunk costs

A pharmaceutical company saying they need to offset the costs for development
are counting on you not understanding the principle of sunk costs. The company
will charge as much as the market allows. The development costs play no role in
that. They’re sunk.

### Opportunity costs

Owning a car has opportunity costs. There’s the obvious financial cost. But
there’s also the cost measured in time and well being when thinking about
having to do maintenance, comparing your car to the one the neighbor has and so
on. Cal Newport has this framed as the any benefit mindset. Owning a car surely has 
benefits. But just because something has any benefit does not mean you 
should get it or do it. Weigh the pros and cons for your situation.

Remember that calculating opportunity costs also has opportunity costs.
Satisficing is a good method to avoid over optimizing things.

### Loss aversion 

Losses weigh heavier than gains. This is why we tend to sell stocks that are
going up rather than the ones that are down. We can't stand the feeling of
locking in on our losses.

### Endowment effect

Owning a thing increases its perceived value. Take note of that next time 
you try to sell something online and are outraged when nobody wants to pay 
200 € for your thirty year old armchair.

## Statistics

Large N increase our confidence in findings. As long as a sample is truly
random we can get away with not making it very large and still get good
results. See voting polls.

### Interview Illusion 

We vastly overestimate our ability to judge someone after meeting them 
for thirty minutes. Rather than basing our assessment of a person on a short 
encounter, we should look at their track record, like grades, endorsements of 
people who have worked with the person for a long time and such.
Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. Just make sure you 
have a large enough N. 

Were overly likely to think one exhibition of a trait is indicator for future
behavior but underestimate the chances of many exhibitions of a trait being
shown again in the future. For abilities we can better realize that a single
exhibition is not telling for overall performance. 

### Reliability and Validity

Reliability: the chances that two doctors say The same thing about a condition.
Or that one doctor says the same thing about a condition on multiple occasions

Validity: the degree to which the statement is actually indicative of the real
situation.

## Ignore the HiPPo

Don’t listen to the highest paid person in the room but get the data. People
make assumptions which tend to be wrong. When looking at what provides the best
outcomes for user retention or number of sales on a website don’t trust your
assumptions but do A/B tests to figure out what’s true.

## Experiments

There’s a hierarchy of different kinds of experiments based on their ability to
tell us something about the world.

First there’s anecdotal evidence. Then there’s MRA (multiple regression
analysis). After that are natural experiments, where one looks at a large
amount of data as it accumulates in the real world and tries to get some
insight from that. And the gold standard is the double blind controlled
experiment.

These controlled experiments can’t be done on humans for a lot of questions due
to ethical reasons. As a proxy we can use animal studies.

When learning something about the world it’s useful to conduct experiments.
Let’s see how we can conduct experiments.

We select a sample of a population. For that we first need to establish what
the population is. Selection of the sample then is very important. Make sure
the sample is selected at random. If there’s some self selection then the
experiments results might be only mildly useful at best and misleading at
worst. The sample should be sufficiently large to be able to have some
confidence in the results. I’ll need to check the word confidence in that
context as there are some words which have special meaning in this sphere.
After randomly selecting a sample from a population one can assign conditions
to them. In the simplest and presumably best case we have two experimental
conditions which we’d like to check. For example some intervention vs no
intervention.

Let’s look at confounding variables here. Time is one obvious aspect. There
might be some global event or trend going on that affects both or one of our
groups. To mitigate this we can maybe repeat the experiment at random
intervals, switch up the conditions between the groups and have a within
design, where we first assign condition A to the first sample and then
condition B to the same sample. Same goes for the other sample.

### Questionnaires

People are highly malleable when it comes to asking them what they think
about a certain topic. Ask people to vote for or against abortion and you can
change the outcome of the survey by placing the voting booth inside a church or
next to the abortion clinic. Or place it next to a prison to conjure up the
image of a rapist. But you don’t have to manipulate the location to get vastly
different results. Changing the wording can have just as great of an effect.

People don’t tend to be very consistent over time when asking them the exact
same thing even. When looking at survey results ask yourself whether the
creator of the survey might have some interest in getting a certain outcome.
Then remember that the people designing the survey have great leverage to
achieve the desired result.

When asking people about their opinions or thoughts consider that they’ll have
some reference group against which they base their answer. Make this reference
group explicit or else you won’t be able to compare the results with what you
intend to compare them with. Also people won’t implicitly have the same
reference group so comparison between people will be useless.

## Dialectical reasoning

Eastern countries have a tradition of dialectical reasoning rather than formal logic.
The following principles characterize eastern thought:

1. Principle of change
  - Reality is a process of change
  - What is currently true will shortly be false
2. Principle of contradiction
  - Contradiction is the dynamic underlying change. Because change is
    constant, contradiction is constant
3. Principle of relationships
  - The whole is more than the sum of its parts
  - Parts are meaningful only in relation to the whole

Note how this mode of thinking complements traditionally western modes of
deductive logic. Nisbett finds some interesting differences in how people from
eastern of western cultures think about certain things. Eastern people pay more
attention to context and can more readily analyze a situation from different
viewpoints.
