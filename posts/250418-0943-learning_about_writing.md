As I write posts on this blog, I'm slowly familiarizing myself with the challenges of writing.
I'm quite happy about having learned a while ago, i think in some youtube video, that one can
just hammer out the words that come to mind without stopping. This is an incredibly fun kind of 
writing. I'm really happy to have come across this information.

I can imagine it being very difficult when perfection is the objective. Sitting
there in front of an empty editor buffer seems stressful.

Recently I got some confirmation for this strategy of simply hammering out the
thoughts at speed by Richard E. Nisbett, in his book 
["Book: Mindware by Richard Nisbett"](../mindware_nisbett). He says that for any work to start
happening on writing one must have something written down, even if it is the
most ridiculous rough draft. The subconcsious needs to get primed or triggered
to be able to tackle the task of forming a coherent structure out of the
dicsonnected thoughts that initially flow to the page.

Up to this point I've been only hammering out stuff on the keyboard. So
everything that can be read here until mid 2025 is something of a direct
readout of my brain. Now for high quality and persuasive writing I'm sure we can agree 
that something more needs to happen.

Today I tried to move on to this second step of refining the jumble that comes
out in the initial hammering phase. It was quite hard. I think I spent like a
good half hour on a tiny paragraph in the [Trying to synthesize learnings on life design](../250417-1718-trying_to_synthesize_learnings_on_life_design) post.
And the result wasn't even any good. So I'll have quite a bit of learning and practicing 
to do on this. Let's think about what this second step of refinement entails. For that
it might be useful to zoom out a bit and look at the writing process as a whole.

Why do I write in the first place? To get a better understanding of things I
learn, be able to make connections between different topics and ideas, and to
arrive at new insights that help me better undestand the world. It's also about 
improving my memory. Not by providing a written record (although that's useful too)
but by concsiously processing the stuff that's floating around in my head. Clive Thompson 
also talks about how writing can help organize ones thinking. More on this book here: ["Book: Smarter Than You Think"](../smarter_than_you_think). Another aspect is that writing like this is just a lot of fun.

So thats my motivation as a hobby blogger. What might a person who would
eventually like to make money by writing or someone like a software engineer
who relies on good writing skills on the job need to get from his writing
practice? A coherent structure would be nice to have. Also persuasiveness, to
get the reader to buy into the ideas I might want to advocate.

What I think I need as a next step is to improve on the practice to make my
arguments clearer to myself, and to question assumptions to get closer to a
truth. I think Charlie Munger is attributed as saying something like "I don't
allow myself an opinion on something unless I've thought all the thoughts that
can be thought against it." I'm very sure what he said is different but the
idea goes something like this. I'll have to look it up in Shane Parrishs book
where I think I stumbled across that one.

Notice how I am now linking to other posts in this blog? That's because now I've set up a separate
vimwiki for my blog. See this post for the process [Improve blogging](../improving_blogging).
 
I guess that thus far my writing has been useful in somewhat organizing my
learnings better and to improve my recollection by performing active recall on
the books I've read and ideas I collected elsewhere. And it has been fun.

While writing this I notice that I haven't got a large store of knowledge about
writing. I might not have read anything specifically focused on writing. That's
a gap I'll have to close. To start with, I'll get me a nice overview from
GenAI.

Now let's get to the challenge I had while editing the brain dump in an earlier
post. First of all I had to recollect what my purpose was in that specific
piece. I had to know the context in which that paragraph stood and how it
related to the rest of the post. I think a good way to go about this would be
to get a high level mental representation of the post by creating clear
separations and chunking parts. These chunks can then be labeled with headings
to make it easier for the mind to get a handle on the post. In this step it
might already become obvious that some parts are duplicated or would fit in at
another place in the post. 

Here we might already be able to move around chunks. But this would be a
destructive action since it might break dependencies to other parts that we're
previously below the moved part and now no longer make sense. So I'd like to
separate the conceptualization step from the action step where I actually make
changes. I like how there's a connection coming up to programming.

There seems to be some value here: The writing itself is what went incredibly quickly 
when creating the first draft but very slow when editing. So I'd like to save
the actual writing to last in the edit step. 

  Given that we have a two step process
  of hammering and editing. Note that this is a one time process, where after hammering 
  is complete there is no going back to it. Editing is brownfield work. Maybe we can 
  break that up too, let's save that thought.
  
Let's break down the edit step: First I'll look at the purpose of the post.
I'll get a overview of whats written and break it down into sensible chunks.
This happens  by inserting line breaks. Then I'll look into the resulting
chunks in more detail and find appropriate headings. By this point I will
already have decent mental map of the post. 

Perhaps a mode of diverging and contracting like in the double diamonds method
from design thinking can come in handy here. After contracting in the chunking
and labeling step, I could diverge and check for any missing ideas or thoughts
that would fit in with the post. 

Maybe the other way around is better, to contract at this stage and find the
true purpose of the post and close in on the main idea that needs to be
transported. To lend a term from Mortimer J. Adlers Book, "How to read a book",
I could try to find the "unity" of the post. The unity is a description of a
book only a few sentences long. I'm trying to get to the point where I can 
start writing again after the conceptualization phase but am struggling 
to find a segway there. The place I want to be after the conceptualization phase
is to be as close as possible to be able to hammer again. But this time 
with better structure and stronger arguments.

Maybe an iterative approach could work, where I repeat hammering and
conceptualization phases until the result is a strong written piece.
That would entail a lot of hammering. My first thought was that this sucks and is 
a lot of work but I'm now kind of excited. This is a grand example of 
a drill as specified in Ultralearning by Scott H. Young (See ["Book: Ultralearning"](../ultralearning)).
So maybe that's the way to go.

To fantasize a little, wouldn't it be nice that at some point after extensive
practice I would have the conceptualization phase so ingrained that it would
happen subconsciously at the time of the first hammering. So I would end up
with a polished post after half an hour of hammering out and enjoying myself.
